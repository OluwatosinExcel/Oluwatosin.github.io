										<h1>About</h1>

									<p>My journey into the world of data began unexpectedly during my polytechnic days in 2017, while studying Mathematics and Statistics. What started as a mere academic requirement quickly turned into a fascination with the power that numbers hold—their ability to reveal hidden insights and tell compelling stories. I remember sitting in class, lost in a maze of equations, when it hit me: data wasn’t just numbers on a page; it was a language—one that could unlock possibilities, change minds, and shape the world.</p>
									<p>From that moment, I threw myself into learning everything I could about data. I began exploring how real-world problems could be solved through analytics, constantly looking for ways to turn raw data into something meaningful. My curiosity led me beyond the classroom, where I started analyzing trends for fun, whether it was social media growth or business metrics. Little did I know that these personal experiments would pave the way for a career I’m so proud of today.</p>
									<p>Fast forward to now, and that love for data has not only grown but has also given me the tools to create real impact. I’ve had the privilege of working with government agencies like the Oyo State Bureau of Statistics, where I helped shape decisions through the power of data. In the private sector, I’ve worked with companies ranging from tech to e-commerce, providing data-driven solutions that boosted their growth and efficiency. One of my most rewarding experiences was leading the registration team for a major tech event in my state, a role that contributed to a 30% increase in the company’s growth—earning me an award for my efforts.</p>
									<p>What’s even more fulfilling is my ability to teach and share this passion. Over the years, I’ve trained students, many of whom have landed their first roles as data analysts within four months. There's nothing quite like watching others unlock the same potential I discovered back in 2017.</p>
									<p>Today, whether I’m collaborating with a team of analysts to solve healthcare challenges in Nigeria or using machine learning to categorize Spotify songs, my drive remains the same: to uncover the hidden stories within data. Because, for me, data is more than just information—it’s the bridge between the problems we see and the solutions we can create.</p>								</div>
